      Daisy Jones & The Six tells the story of a fictional 1970s rock band from their tumultuous rise to their equally dramatic and sudden fall. The book is formatted as a retrospective oral history, with the band members and their inner circle offering differing accounts of events surrounding their fame. The story primarily follows the creative and intensely complicated relationship between charismatic but troubled singers Daisy Jones and Billy Dunne, who are brought together to create a hugely successful album called Aurora. Their passionate connection and personal demons, including Billy's struggle with sobriety, become central to the band's dynamic. Amid the tensions, the group embarks on a sold-out world tour before breaking up suddenly at the height of their success. In the end, the memoir reveals that Billy and Daisy's romantic feelings for each other and a confrontation with Billy's wife Camila were the driving forces behind the band's shocking end.
