      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Cara Kelley and I am 21 years old. I am a senior at Lehigh studying Graphic Design and Marketing. In my web design class. we have been asked to create a web page regarding a hobby of ours. For my web page, I chose reading. I have loved reading since I was a kid. I enjoy everything from fantasy novels to historical biographies. But my favorite genres currently are realistic fiction and mystery. Books take me places Iâ€™ve never been and inspire my imagination.</p>
      <p>Here is a little bit more about me: I grew up with my mom, dad, and 2 brothers. Besides reading I enjoy spending time with friends and family, playing with my dog, and going to the beach.</p>
