      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Cara Kelley and I am 21 years old. I am a senior at Lehigh studying Graphic Design and Marketing. In my web design class. we have been asked to create a web page regarding a hobby of ours. For my web page, I chose reading. I have loved reading since I was a kid. I enjoy everything from fantasy novels to historical biographies. But my favorite genres currently are realistic fiction and mystery. Books take me places Iâ€™ve never been and inspire my imagination.</p>

     <h2>My Favorite Books</h2>
     <ul>
       <li><strong>28 Summers</strong> by Ellen Hildebrand</li>
       <p class="highlight">
       Elin Hilderbrandâ€™s 28 Summers follows Mallory Blessing, who begins a secret Labor Day weekend tradition with Jake McCloud after they meet in 1993. Despite Jake marrying Ursula de Gournsey, who later becomes a prominent presidential candidate, and Mallory raising her son alone, the two keep their yearly promise for nearly three decades. Each chapter moves through a different year, tying their love story to real-world events and changes in their personal lives. Their bond is deep and undeniable, but it comes with sacrifices, secrecy, and the strain of leading separate lives the rest of the year. When Mallory becomes gravely ill, the future of their long-kept tradition is brought into question, and both must confront what their relationship has meant.

       <li><strong>Verity</strong> by Colleen Hoover</li>
       <p class="highlight">
       In Colleen Hoover's psychological thriller Verity, struggling writer Lowen Ashleigh accepts a job completing the book series of famous author Verity Crawford, who is now incapacitated after an accident. Lowen moves into the Crawford home and, while sorting through Verity's notes, finds an unfinished, disturbing autobiography. The manuscript details Verity's sinister actions, including her abusive jealousy and the truth behind her daughter's death. As Lowen falls for Verity's husband, Jeremy, she becomes entangled in the family's dark secrets and a chilling web of deception. The story concludes with a shocking twist that leaves the reader questioning who was truly telling the truth: the manuscript or a final, contradictory letter left by Verity. 
       </p>
       <li><strong>Daisy Jones &amp; The Six</strong> by Taylor Jenkins Reid</li>
       <p class="highlight">
       Daisy Jones &amp; The Six tells the story of a fictional 1970s rock band from their tumultuous rise to their equally dramatic and sudden fall. The book is formatted as a retrospective oral history, with the band members and their inner circle offering differing accounts of events surrounding their fame. The story primarily follows the creative and intensely complicated relationship between charismatic but troubled singers Daisy Jones and Billy Dunne, who are brought together to create a hugely successful album called Aurora. Their passionate connection and personal demons, including Billy's struggle with sobriety, become central to the band's dynamic. Amid the tensions, the group embarks on a sold-out world tour before breaking up suddenly at the height of their success. In the end, the memoir reveals that Billy and Daisy's romantic feelings for each other and a confrontation with Billy's wife Camila were the driving forces behind the band's shocking end. 
       </p>
